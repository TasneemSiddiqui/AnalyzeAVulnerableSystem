<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
<h2>December 1, 2024</h2>

<h3>System Description</h3>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
<h3>Scope</h3>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024. <a href="">NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1<a></a> is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
<h3>Purpose</h3>

The database server is valuable to the business because employees use it to query data to find potential customers. It stores and manages large amounts of data. It is important for the business to secure the data on the server because keeping it open to the public is a serious vulnerability. If the server were disabled, the organization would be at a financial loss, as the server is regularly used for marketing operations.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>

|Threat source|	Threat event|	Likelihood|	Severity|	Risk|
|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Employee	|Alter/Delete critical information	|2	|3	|6|
|Hacker	|Disrupt mission-critical operations	|3	|3	|9|
|System administrator	|Alter/Delete critical information	|1	|3	|3|
<h3>Approach</h3>
This section documents the approach used to conduct the vulnerability assessment report. It is important to be clear and concise when writing your approach. A transparent summary of your approach helps stakeholders understand that the assessment is credible and that the results can be used to make informed decisions.
Consider the following questions to help you write an approach section:
What was your rationale for selecting the risks that you evaluated?
How were you deriving the likelihood and severity scores of each risk?
What were the limitations of the assessment?

A database that is publicly accessible is prone to being altered either accidentally by employees / system administrators, or maliciously by hackers. This knowledge was used to determine the likelihood and severity scores for each risk....
<h3>Remediation Strategy</h3>
This section provides specific and actionable recommendations to remediate or mitigate the risks that were assessed. Any recommendations that you make should be realistic and achievable. Overall, the remediation section of a vulnerability assessment report helps to ensure that risks are addressed in a timely and effective manner.
Consider the following questions to help you write a remediation strategy:
Which technical, operational, or managerial controls are currently implemented to secure the system?
Are there security controls that can reduce the risks you evaluated? What are those controls and how would they remediate the risks?
How will the results of the assessment improve the overall security of the system?


The current security measures in place are that the organization has the latest version of Linux operating system, and they use SSL/TLS encrypted connections. Implementing authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms would ensure that only authorized users access the database server.....
