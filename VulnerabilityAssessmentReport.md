<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
<h3>December 1, 2024</h3>

<h3>System Description</h3>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
<h3>Scope</h3>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024. <a href="https://github.com/TasneemSiddiqui/AnalyzeAVulnerableSystem/blob/main/NIST-SP-800-30_Rev.-1.md">NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1<a></a> is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
<h3>Purpose</h3>

The database server is valuable to the business because employees use it to query data to find potential customers. It stores and manages large amounts of data. It is important for the business to secure the data on the server because keeping it open to the public is a serious vulnerability. If the server were disabled, the organization would be at a financial loss, as the server is regularly used for marketing operations.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>

|Threat source|	Threat event|	Likelihood|	Severity|	Risk|
|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Employee	|Alter/Delete critical information	|2	|3	|6|
|Hacker	|Disrupt mission-critical operations	|3	|3	|9|
|System administrator	|Alter/Delete critical information	|1	|3	|3|
<h3>Approach</h3>

A database that is publicly accessible is prone to being altered either accidentally by employees / system administrators, or maliciously by hackers. Potential threat sources and events were determined using the likelihood of a security incident because of the open access permissions of the information system. The likelihood and severity scores for each risk was determined based on the impact on day-to-day operational needs. 
<h3>Remediation Strategy</h3>
The current security measures in place are that the organization has the latest version of Linux operating system, and they use SSL/TLS encrypted connections. Implementing authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms would ensure that only authorized users access the database server. Strong passwords, role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication can be used to limit user privileges.
